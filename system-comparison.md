  - Cores: 12 physical
  - Threads: 24 (with SMT)
  - Generation: Zen 3 (2020)
  - TDP: 105W
  - Cache: 64MB L3 (huge!)

- **RAM**: 64GB DDR4
  - Speed: Likely 3200-3600 MHz
  - Quad Channel potential
  
- **GPU**: Depends on host config
  - Potential for GPU passthrough
  - NPU acceleration possible

### Expected Performance
- Single-threaded: ~3,500 PassMark score (4.4x improvement)
- Multi-threaded: ~39,000 PassMark score (24x improvement!)
- Memory bandwidth: ~50-75 GB/s
- Cache performance: 20x larger L3 cache

## Real-World Impact for Our Work

### Compilation Speed
- **Current**: `cargo build` on domovoi takes ~2 minutes
- **Ryzen**: Expected ~10-15 seconds (12x faster)

### Variety Simulation Capacity
- **Current**: Can simulate ~100 agents comfortably
- **Ryzen**: Can simulate 10,000+ agents with room to spare

### Tensor Operations
- **Current**: CPU-bound, no acceleration
- **Ryzen**: 
  - Massive parallel compute via 24 threads
  - AVX2/AVX512 instructions for tensor ops
  - Potential for GPU compute if passed through

### Development Experience
- **Current**: 
  - Noticeable lag in IDE operations
  - Browser + IDE + builds = system stress
  - Limited multitasking

- **Ryzen**:
  - Instant IDE response
  - Run multiple VMs simultaneously
  - Live-compile everything
  - Run full test suites in parallel

## Specific Benefits for A2A Firewall Development

1. **Agent Simulation Scale**
   - Test realistic enterprise scenarios (1000s of agents)
   - Simulate entire agricultural cooperatives
   - Run multiple attack scenarios simultaneously

2. **Tensor Processing**
   - Real-time variety navigation calculations
   - Meta-tensor operations at scale
   - NPU emulation for testing

3. **Build Performance**
   - Near-instant Rust compilations
   - Parallel test execution
   - Multiple project builds simultaneously

4. **VMware Advantages**
   - Snapshots for testing different attacks
   - Network isolation for security testing
   - Easy environment replication

## VMware Optimization Recommendations

### VM Configuration
```
CPU: 8-10 cores (leave some for host)
RAM: 32GB (half of total)
Disk: 200GB thin provisioned
Network: Bridged for development
```

### Performance Tweaks
- Enable nested virtualization
- Disable visual effects in KDE
- Use virtio drivers where possible
- Enable hardware acceleration

## Migration Checklist
