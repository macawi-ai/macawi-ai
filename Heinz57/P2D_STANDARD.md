# MACAWI P2D™ Standard - The Platinum Standard for Agentic Security

## Executive Summary

The MACAWI P2D™ (Paranoid to Debug) Standard provides a universal security posture configuration language that bridges the gap between technical security controls and business risk management. By establishing five clearly defined security levels, P2D enables consistent security decision-making across all aspects of agentic infrastructure.

## P2D Security Levels

### PARANOID - Maximum Security Mode

**Target Industries:**
- Critical Infrastructure (Power, Water, Gas utilities)
- Industrial Control Systems (ICS/SCADA)
- Healthcare/Medical Device Networks
- Nuclear/Chemical/Manufacturing Plants
- Air-gapped or Previously Air-gapped Networks

**Default Behavior:**
- Deny by default for all unknown patterns
- Zero tolerance for protocol deviations
- Immediate termination of suspicious sessions
- Full packet capture and forensics
- Mandatory multi-factor authentication
- No binary or encoded data unless explicitly whitelisted

**Business Translation:** "Nothing gets through unless explicitly approved and continuously validated"

### STRICT - High Security Mode

**Target Industries:**
- Financial Services (Banks, Credit Unions)
- Payment Processors (PCI-DSS environments)
- Regulated Financial (FDIC/OCC/FFIEC compliance)
- Government Classified Networks
- Cryptocurrency/Blockchain Infrastructure

**Default Behavior:**
- Allow known-good patterns only
- Rapid response to anomalies
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Mandatory encryption verification
- Session limits and rate controls
- Automated threat response integration

**Business Translation:** "Regulatory compliance with operational awareness"

### BALANCED - Production Security Mode

**Target Industries:**
- Enterprise Business Networks
- SaaS Platforms
- Retail Operations (non-PCI zones)
- Standard Corporate IT
- B2B Integration Networks

**Default Behavior:**
- Security with operational continuity
- Alert on suspicious, block on dangerous
- Standard logging and SIEM integration
- Grace periods for authentication renewal
- Business-hour considerations
- Performance-aware security

**Business Translation:** "Keep the business running while maintaining security"

### PERMISSIVE - Learning/Testing Mode

**Valid Use Cases:**
- New Implementation Testing
- Pre-production Environments
- Security Tool Tuning
- Partner Integration Testing
- Migration Phases
- Proof of Concepts

**Default Behavior:**
- Allow most traffic, log everything
- Generate alerts without blocking
- Learn normal patterns
- Identify potential future rules
- Time-boxed usage periods
- Continuous visibility warnings

**Business Translation:** "Learning mode with full visibility - temporary use only"

### DEBUG - Development Mode

**Valid Use Cases:**
- Development Environments
- Troubleshooting Production Issues
- Security Research
- Protocol Analysis
- Vendor Support Sessions

**Default Behavior:**
- Allow all, capture everything
- Maximum verbosity logging
- No security enforcement
- Full packet capture
- Session recording
- Mandatory alerting to security team

**Business Translation:** "Glass box mode for problem solving - requires security approval"

## P2D Visibility Requirements

### Mandatory Alerting for Non-Production Modes

```yaml
PERMISSIVE_Mode_Alerts:
  Initial_Alert: "System configured in PERMISSIVE mode"
  Periodic_Warning: Every 4 hours
  Escalation: After 24 hours continuous use
  Required_Fields:
    - Business justification
    - Expected duration
    - Responsible party
    
DEBUG_Mode_Alerts:
  Initial_Alert: "CRITICAL: System in DEBUG mode"
  Periodic_Warning: Every hour
  Escalation: After 4 hours continuous use
  Auto_Revert: After 8 hours unless extended
  CEO_Alert: If financial/critical systems
```

## Industry-Specific Default Configurations

### Critical Infrastructure Profile
```yaml
Default_Level: PARANOID
Override_Requires: C-Suite approval
Downgrade_Duration: 4 hours maximum
Audit_Requirement: Board-level review
```

### Financial Services Profile
```yaml
Default_Level: STRICT
Override_Requires: CISO approval
Downgrade_Duration: 24 hours maximum
Audit_Requirement: Compliance team review
```

### Enterprise Business Profile
```yaml
Default_Level: BALANCED
Override_Requires: Security team approval
Upgrade_Encouraged: For sensitive zones
Audit_Requirement: Quarterly review
```

## P2D Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Default Selection Logic
```
IF critical_infrastructure OR medical OR industrial:
    DEFAULT = PARANOID
ELIF financial OR payment_processing OR compliance_required:
    DEFAULT = STRICT
ELIF standard_enterprise:
    DEFAULT = BALANCED
ELSE:
    DEFAULT = BALANCED with recommendation to assess
```

### 2. Mode Transition Rules
- Can always upgrade to more secure level instantly
- Downgrading requires authorization and time-boxing
- Automatic reversion to default after time period
- All transitions logged and alerted

### 3. Visibility and Compliance
- All P2D levels visible in executive dashboards
- Compliance reports show P2D distribution
- Deviations from defaults require documentation
- Integration with GRC platforms

## P2D Business Benefits

1. **Universal Language:** CEOs to Engineers understand "We run PARANOID mode"
2. **Audit Friendly:** "Show me everything not in STRICT or PARANOID"
3. **Risk Communication:** "Upgrading to PARANOID during threat window"
4. **Partner Clarity:** "Minimum BALANCED required for B2B connection"
5. **Compliance Mapping:** Direct correlation to regulatory requirements

## Integration with Security Controls

Every security decision in the MACAWI platform uses P2D levels:
- Firewall rules
- Authentication requirements  
- Encryption standards
- Logging verbosity
- Alert thresholds
- Session limits
- Rate controls
- Content inspection

## Trademark and Compliance
