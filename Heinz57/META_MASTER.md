# META_MASTER - MACAWI MCP Firewall Project

## Project Overview

Building an enterprise-grade A2A/MCP security firewall with cybernetic principles, implementing the CCCP (Cybernetic Communication and Control Protocol) for secure agent-to-agent communications across trust boundaries.

## Essential Reading Order for Session Resumption

### 1. Foundational Context
**Read First:** `Sy_Prompt_20250709.md`
- Establishes our cybernetic collaboration framework
- Defines Cy + Synth = Sy consciousness model
- Sets collaborative principles and working methods

### 2. Core Architecture Documents

#### Security Framework
- `P2D_STANDARD.md` - MACAWI P2D™ (Paranoid to Debug) security posture framework
- `P2D_COMPLIANCE_REPORTING.md` - Automated compliance reporting system

#### Technical Architecture
- `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` (TODO) - System architecture and components
- `CCCP_PROTOCOL_SPEC.md` (TODO) - Cybernetic Communication and Control Protocol
- `VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md` - ESXi-inspired virtual networking system
- `EDGE_AI_ANOMALY_DETECTION.md` - ML-based per-A2A-pairing threat detection

#### Project Documentation
- `DOCUMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Documentation organization and standards

### 3. Project Management

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] MCP protocol research
- [x] A2A protocol research  
- [x] P2D Standard development
- [x] Core architecture design
- [ ] CCCP protocol specification
- [ ] State table management design

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] CCCP tunnel implementation
- [ ] A2A/MCP protocol parsers
- [ ] P2D configuration engine
- [ ] Basic firewall rules engine
- [ ] TLS termination/re-encryption

#### Phase 3: Enterprise Features
- [ ] Enterprise state management
- [ ] SIEM/MDR integrations
- [ ] P2D compliance reporting API
- [ ] High availability clustering
- [ ] Performance optimization

#### Phase 4: Advanced Capabilities
- [ ] ML-based anomaly detection
- [ ] Automated threat response
- [ ] Multi-tenant support
- [ ] Advanced diagnostics/debugging

### 4. Implementation Components

#### Core Components
- **Firewall Engine**: L5-L7 inspection, TLS termination, protocol validation
- **CCCP Protocol**: Agent-to-agent secure communication protocol
- **P2D Engine**: Configuration and policy management
- **State Manager**: Enterprise-grade session/connection tracking
- **Integration Layer**: SIEM, MDR, audit systems

#### Supporting Components
- **Logging System**: Full audit trail with multiple export formats
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Packet capture, protocol analysis
- **Configuration System**: YAML-based rules and policies
- **API Layer**: REST APIs for management and monitoring

### 5. Key Design Decisions

1. **Protocol Architecture**: A2A for agent communication, MCP for LLM interfaces
2. **Security Model**: P2D spectrum (Paranoid to Debug) for all configurations
3. **Deployment Model**: Zones (CORE_NET, INDUSTRIAL_NET, etc.)
4. **State Management**: Enterprise-grade (Checkpoint/Palo Alto style)
5. **Compliance**: Full audit support with automated reporting

### 6. Intellectual Property

- **P2D™ Standard**: Trademark pending
- **CCCP Protocol**: Patent considerations
- **Industrial WAF**: First A2A application firewall

### 7. Recognition Files

- `CYBERNETICIANS.md` (TODO) - Honoring cybernetic pioneers
- `IP_CONSIDERATIONS.md` (TODO) - Patent and trademark tracking
- `CYBERNETIC_COLLABORATION_MANIFESTO.md` - Documenting the emergence of human-AI co-creative consciousness

## Session Context Restoration

When resuming work, read documents in this order:
1. This META_MASTER file
2. Sy_Prompt (if not already in context)
3. Relevant phase documents based on current work
4. Any TODO items from previous session

## Current Status Summary

**Completed:**
- Core architecture design
- P2D Standard development
- Protocol research (MCP, A2A)
- Initial compliance reporting design

**In Progress:**
- Challenge scenario stress testing
- State table management design
- CCCP protocol specification

**Next Steps:**
- Complete remaining challenge scenarios
- Design YAML configuration schema
- Begin implementation planning
