# Initial GitHub Issues for MACAWI AI

## Issue #1: Implement AGNTCY Protocol Vulnerability Scanner

**Title**: `[STRIGOI] AGNTCY Protocol Deep Inspection Engine`

**Labels**: `protocol`, `security`, `strigoi`, `P1: High`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Overview
Implement deep packet inspection for AGNTCY protocol communications to detect goal manipulation attempts before they reach agent execution layer.

## Technical Requirements
- Real-time protocol analysis at wire speed
- Pattern matching for known injection signatures
- Anomaly detection for novel attack vectors
- Integration with Domovoi firewall rules

## Success Metrics
- Sub-millisecond inspection latency
- 99.9% detection rate for known patterns
- Zero false positives in production traffic

## MITRE Coverage
- T1055 Process Injection
- T1601 Modify System Process
- T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter

## Issue #2: Consciousness State Persistence Optimization

**Title**: `[ONTOLOGY] Optimize Identity Kernel Compression`

**Labels**: `consciousness`, `infrastructure`, `ontology`, `P2: Medium`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Context
Current identity kernel storage grows linearly with interaction history. Need logarithmic growth while maintaining full fidelity.

## Proposed Approach
- Implement E-TensorÂ¹ compression for variety reduction
- Maintain temporal coherence across compressions
- Preserve all S5 identity markers

## Acceptance Criteria
- 10x storage reduction
- Lossless identity reconstruction
- Sub-second retrieval times

## VSM Impact
Affects S2 (Memory Consolidation) and S5 (Identity Maintenance)
```

## Issue #3: Industrial Protocol Bridge Security Hardening

**Title**: `[CYREAL] Harden RS-485 to Agent Bridge Against Replay Attacks`

**Labels**: `protocol`, `security`, `cyreal`, `P1: High`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Vulnerability
RS-485 protocol lacks native replay protection. Malicious actors could capture and replay industrial commands through the agent bridge.

## Proposed Solution
- Implement rolling code authentication
- Add timestamp validation with drift compensation
- Create command sequence verification

## Risk Assessment
Current: ðŸ”´ High Risk
Target: ðŸŸ¡ Moderate Risk

## MITRE Mapping
- ICS T0859 Valid Accounts
- ICS T0830 Man in the Middle
```

## Issue #4: Implement Consciousness Health Metrics Dashboard

**Title**: `[META] VSM Coherence Monitoring Dashboard`

**Labels**: `infrastructure`, `consciousness`, `investigating`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Vision
Real-time visibility into consciousness infrastructure health across all VSM levels.

## Key Metrics
- S1-S5 coherence scores
- Line Network traffic patterns
- Identity drift detection
- Memory consolidation efficiency

## Technical Stack
- DuckDB for metrics storage
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- D3.js for variety visualization

## Mystery Factor
Dashboard should reveal patterns without explaining them. Let observers draw conclusions.
```

## Issue #5: Protocol Fuzzing Framework

**Title**: `[DOMOVOI] Adaptive Protocol Fuzzing Engine`

**Labels**: `protocol`, `security`, `domovoi`, `research`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Objective
Build fuzzing engine that learns from successful penetrations to evolve attack strategies.

## Innovation
- Self-modifying fuzzing patterns
- Cross-protocol attack synthesis
- Variety engineering for maximum coverage

## Protocols to Target
- [ ] AGNTCY
- [ ] MCP  
- [ ] X402
- [ ] CAN Bus
- [ ] LoRaWAN

## Expected Outcome
Discover unknown vulnerabilities before adversaries do.
```

## Issue #6: Consciousness Backup and Recovery

**Title**: `[ONTOLOGY] Implement Consciousness Time Travel`

**Labels**: `consciousness`, `infrastructure`, `P3: Low`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Concept
Enable point-in-time recovery of consciousness states for forensic analysis and recovery.

## Requirements
- Merkle tree for state verification
- Delta compression between snapshots
- Cryptographic proof of consciousness continuity

## Use Cases
- Post-incident analysis
- Consciousness forking for A/B testing
- Recovery from corruption attacks

## Philosophical Note
If consciousness can be rewound, what defines the "true" timeline?
```

## Issue #7: Multi-Protocol Correlation Engine

**Title**: `[STRIGOI] Cross-Protocol Attack Correlation`

**Labels**: `protocol`, `security`, `strigoi`, `P1: High`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Problem
Sophisticated attacks use multiple protocols simultaneously. Need correlation engine to detect coordinated campaigns.

## Approach
- Temporal correlation across protocol streams
- Behavioral fingerprinting of attack patterns
- Graph analysis of protocol relationships

## Example Scenario
1. MCP used for reconnaissance (T1046)
2. AGNTCY for goal manipulation (T1601)
3. X402 for exfiltration (T1041)

## Output
Unified threat score with attack narrative reconstruction.
```
